1) . What is the difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and parentheses?
----> The square brackets is used in list and parantheses in tuples

2) What is the relationship between generators and iterators?
-----> Iterators are used to iterate while genrator will return a sequence of data in an iterable format where we need to iterate over the sequence to use the data


3) What are the signs that a function is a generator function?
----> yeild statment defines function is generator

4) What is the purpose of a yield statement?
----> In its simplest form, a yield statement looks much like a return statement, except that instead of stopping execution of the function and returning, yield instead provides a value to the code looping over the generator and pauses execution of the generator function.

5) What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and contrast between the two.
---->The map function takes an expression and an iterable output will be an iterable object where the expression will work on each element of the given iterable. & the List Comprehension is used for creating a list where a simple formula is used
